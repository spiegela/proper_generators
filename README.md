# PropEr Generators
A Collection of PropEr Generators for Erlangers to Share

It's just what it sounds like.  It's a public repository of [PropEr](http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr) generators for people to share and learn from.  Both general purpose and application specific generators are welcome.

## How to contribute

Fork, Edit, Commit, submit PR.  I will merge ASAP.

## Library structure

I have done _no_ work to organize things at this stage.  There's not enough content, yet.  We'll have to burn that bridge once we cross the rubicon.
